The shapes are geometric and stylised — curved planes, clean lines — creating symmetry and calm.

## Abstract

This essay examines the University of Reading’s LLM programme as a microcosm of systemic tendencies within contemporary higher education.  It argues that what appears as an isolated pedagogical experience in fact reflects broader epistemic and ethical dynamics—**epistemic clientelism**, where recognition is exchanged for conformity, and **optocratic drift**, where visibility replaces truth as the organising principle of institutional life.  Through the analytical frameworks of _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ (Kahl 2025d) and _Epistemocracy in Higher Education_ (Kahl 2025g), the study interprets the LLM environment as a site where managerial aesthetics and moral caution converge to suppress dialogical learning.  Feedback rituals, group-based assessments, and the omnipresence of leadership imagery exemplify a culture of procedural participation that manages emotion rather than cultivates candour.

Against this backdrop, the essay proposes a constructive alternative: a **pedagogy of fiduciary dialogue**.  Drawing on Kahl’s (2025b, 2025e, 2025p) fiduciary-epistemic ethics, it envisions education as reciprocal trusteeship—an ethical relationship in which teachers and students share responsibility for sustaining truth through candour, trust, and justice.  By reframing feedback as covenant rather than survey, the essay performs its own argument: it offers feedback by other means, modelling what institutional dialogue might become when critique is understood not as dissent but as stewardship.  In doing so, it advances a vision of the university as a fiduciary polity of knowledge—one governed by conscience rather than optics, and by care rather than compliance.
